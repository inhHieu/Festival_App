# Festival_App
This mobile app version is an extension of the Nha Trang Festival graduation project. It shares the same backend as the website version, which is a .NET API Restful with JWT authentication.
It is created as a hobby to learn new skills.
Currently, it is not completed and outdated. I will work on it after finishing the 2024 crash course.
